# EasyEditCard
low funds this year while job hunting after a 3 month bootcamp, so why not deploy a free basic card for personal use and maybe some exposure

Set up to make you own after forking and cloning.

1. 'npm install' to install dependencies.
2. 'npm run dev' to have webpack compile on saves while editing.
3. after editing src/App.jsx line 22 how you want, deploy on a free site using npm run build after cloning and running step 1 again in the instance terminal, then npm run server to get the server up and running.
4. After checking thats working stop the server and run 'screen -d -m npm run server', to keep the server running after closing the terminal
